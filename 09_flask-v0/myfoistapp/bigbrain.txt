K09 -- Learning flask day 1

Q0: Where have you seen similar syntax in other langs?
This seems like the object of a certain class creation in java (initialization?).
EDIT: It seems it indeed assigned the variable to a new Flask class object.
Q1: What points of reference do you have for meaning of '/'?
This is the header for path files, so its likely specifying that the root file for the website is here (and relative)
EDIT: This seems to be correct.
Q2: Where will this print to?
print() prints to console.
EDIT: This also seems to be correct.
Q3: What will it print?
It will print the '__name__' variable
EDIT:
That turned out to be "
 * Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
"
At the very least it seems like the name of the file?
Q3: Will this appear anywhere? How u know?
No it will not appear anywhere, because we never called it again. If it did, it would be in the console, because that's what print() does.
EDIT:
It does, print() prints in the console and return returns the text to the browser. @app.route("/") seems to suggest say "if they try to access website.com/, serve them with this function"
Q4: Where have you seen similar construcs in other languages?
This again seems very javaonic and reminiscent of the time I used JavaFX.
EDIT: This is getting closer and closer to that time I used javaFX, although JavaFX was effectively just a browser...

Notes:
Running the program results in this printout:
" * Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)" in console.

Attempted to connect to home IP at port 5000 (above IP) via https. Resulted in this printout:

Says this in browser (corresponding to above console printout):
"Secure Connection Failed

An error occurred during a connection to 127.0.0.1:5000. SSL received a record that exceeded the maximum permissible length.

Error code: SSL_ERROR_RX_RECORD_TOO_LONG

    The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because the authenticity of the received data could not be verified.
    Please contact the website owners to inform them of this problem."

Looking at the file, nothing seems to be declared except that the server exists, so the 400 error makes sense since the server cannot handle a request (as its basically nothing right now) and the browser therefore gets nothing in response. We did not set up our HTTPS protocols, so this error makes sense.

Retrying with http:
Prints following in console:
"__main__
127.0.0.1 - - [02/Oct/2021 23:14:27] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
127.0.0.1 - - [02/Oct/2021 23:14:27] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 -


"

Says the following in browser:
"No hablo queso!"

It seems return in hello_world() results in the html printout. The problem is where is this being fed? Flask class object is being run, but what is it doing? Where is __name__ declared?
