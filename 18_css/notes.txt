Inline CSS
 - divs are very important to separate HTML portions when CSSing.
 - It is difficult to downright impossible to do a lot of CSS designs without divs.
 - Also very messy and repetitive. Code looks very bloated and lots of repeating portions.
Internal CSS
 - Classes make for good organization
 - makes code a lot clearer but big CSS block at top
 External CSS
 - Classes make for good organization
 - Extremely similar in style to internal CSS sans the linking versus big CSS block.
