### Pain factor: _
(0=ezpz...5=nightmare)
3 - I've used this API before, or a similar one in Django. It's pretty neat, but due to the complexity of DND also a bit of a headache to figure out. It has very good documentation, however, and you should be able to figure it out fairly quickly after a few learning pains.
---
### Key Provisioning:     
 - This API is open source and free.
 - This API does not require an API key.
 - This API is a read only API.
	 - Errors found in SRD documentation thus are to be reported via bug report.
### Quotas:
 - This is an open source API. there are no quotas listed anywhere on the website.
---
## The Good:
 - Open source, so if you have an issue, you can code the fix yourself.
 - Data is returned in a JSON format for easy processing.
 - It's free to use for your independent projects.
## The Bad:
 - Open source and not officially run by WoTC (D&D creators). This means any issues you have may take a while to resolve.
 - It also means it is reliant on other people to maintain the servers to keep it running, rather than WoTC themselves. The API can become deprecated very quickly like this.
## The Ugly:
 - This uses WoTC SRD material. This means it is operating legally in a clean zone, but could be subject to legal issues should WoTC decide to pull the rug on their SRD program.
 - You will not get any D&D supplements like XGtE and SCAG as those are WoTC property.
 - You cannot add homebrew to this like you could with the DNDBeyond infrastructure.
