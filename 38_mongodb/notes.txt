Query Operators:
 - additional way to modify queries
 - used with $
 - comparison operators
  - $eq: ==
  - $ne: !=
  - $gt: >
  - $lt: <
  - $gte: >=
  - $lte: <=
  - syntax: {field: {operator:value}}
  - $eq is implicit when using find in a fashion where you're providing a field:value pair.
 - need db.collection.command() to query it
 - logic operators
  - $and - all queries true
   - implicit when not specified
   - explicit and when including the same operator more than once in a query
  - $or - at least one query true
  - $nor - not or
  - syntax: {operator: [{statement1}, ...]}
  - $not - negation of query
  - syntax: {$not: {statement}}
 - expressive query operator
  - $expr -- it can do more than 1 simple operation
  - allows the use of aggregation expressions within query
  - {$expr: {expression}}
  - also allows variables and conditional expressions
   - uses $ to denote field variable
   - changes all comparison/logic operators into arrays with aggregation
    - Syntax: {$expr :{ $operator : ["$value", "$value2"]}}
