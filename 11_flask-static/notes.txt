# app.py does not seem to be much different in structure, and only minimally in execution (the printout is only a bit different) from V4 from K10

foo: What happens when you access this file
	 via
	 http://localhost:5000/static/foo
	 ?

prediction: it asks you to download the file, and then it does,
result: It asks you to save the foo file, and then opens it with its full contents (if firefox gives you the option to, it sometimes does not).

What happens when you access this file via
		 http://localhost:5000/static/foo.html?

prediction: it serves up the HTML file as a regular html file.
result: it serves the HTML as if you just opened an HTML file with firefox.
