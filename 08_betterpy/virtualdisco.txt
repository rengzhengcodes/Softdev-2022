-m: module name
venv: creates virtual environment
~/myherozero: venv created in root directory folder myherozero.
A virtual environment is a way to add libraries for a module with PIP.
  -they do this separately from global libraries, allowing you to manage which project uses which libraries.
  -You get into a venv via the source command and a path to the activate file.
  -You do this in the console.
    -from prior experience, applications opened by the console with the venv open also use the venv
    -from prior experience as well, venvs help prevent library version conflicts.
