Questions:
Does random.choices() use a different method than what we used?
Why was random choosing of names so popular?
Why does everyone use open(file) as f instead of a more compact method + comment explainer?
Comments:
Michelle and my group used the same adding interval method of choice.
People seem to prefer spaces over tabs.
random.choices() exists.
Concerns:
Overhead risks of importing libraries?
People don't seem to comment very verbosely.
