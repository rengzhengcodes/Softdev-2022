1. Inserting Documents to Collections
  1. UI
    1. Add entry by hitting insert document bottom at top right of collections view.
    2. Two views, using JSON notation with "{}" menu or with one field-value pair at a time using the default view.
    3. _id field value will already be populated.
      1. Every doc must have an _id field, and each document in a collection must have a unique id.
      2. This separates them from other documents with the same other values.
      3. Collections also don't have to be isodimensional.
      4. Nothing prevents all same or all different data.
        1. But this isn't best practice, at all.
    4. When inserting a document, the _id field is populated with type ObjectId. It doesn't have to be this, but it's created by default to ensure uniqueness.
      1. If you have another unique value, you can use that for _id instead
    5. Good practice to keep records relatively consistent.
    6. Use mouse to move from field to value + add new fields. You can also use Tab.
    7. Hit insert to insert the document.
