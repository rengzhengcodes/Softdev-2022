BSON if you don't want to view, JSON if you want to
mongodump exports as BSON.
mongoexport exports as JSON.
mongorestore imports BSON.
mongoimport imports from JSON.
```--drop``` drops the table.

  - Atlas UI to view everything in collections
  - Has a search feature + filters
  - format is collection.document

Find Command:
  - Shell equivalent of the UI
  - use db to go to db
  - show collections to find the collections available
  - db.collection_name.find(query) is the find command
  - it = iterate through the db cursor
  - .count() = number of queries returned
  - .pretty() = format data
