Notes:
* Jinja templates look like a combination between string kwargs and
interpreting Python commands.
* Jinja templates effectively are pythonic.

EGO:
* The author uses the generic "he" to refer to a programmer as opposed to
"he or she" or "they".
* Seek help, laugh off mistakes, be good humored.
* Emphasis on readability: makes more organized and maintainable code that
makes every other part easier/faster to develop
* Looks like many companies are gatekeeping this really efficient form of
programming: why?
