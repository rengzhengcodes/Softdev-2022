 - If apache works when you enter the IP address/url into a browser, you should get a page served with " Apache2 Ubuntu Default Page " as the header.
 - If it tells you to restart when you ssh in, restart I guess.

 - Deviances: installed python3-pip
 - if you use sudo, it does not install it in the venv, it installs it for all python.
 - put app.run() inside a conditional to not have runaway processes

www-data
[_] _ _ _|_ _ _|_ _ _
permissions (1st to see if if its a directory)
left to right:
users, group, world
sub groups:
read, write, execute (rwx)

ls -al #permissions
chmod 770 file #user, group all permissions, everyone not
chmod tx #all execute

we want usually 755 for webhosting.

www-data is how apache shows up in the users list.
 - owner of the process of a machine
 - top #shows processes
 - q #quits top
 - If you see a user associated with a process and its www-data, it's apache
 - if you want to give apache ownership of a file, chown it to apache
	 - chown www-data file # change from www-data to file
	 - chgrp www-data file # change from www-data to group
 - www-data needs to own both the directory and the db file to write to it.
 - you need to specify the db abs. path as www-data does not use the same rel path as __init__.py
 - changing the first slash on "WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/FlaskApp/flaskapp.wsgi" puts the WSGI path on a specific subdirectory.
