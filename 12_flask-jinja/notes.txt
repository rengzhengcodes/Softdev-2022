#Q0: What happens if you remove render_template from this line?
Prediction: the places that call the render_template function will break.
Reality: Correct! The server also serves up a NameError html page for it, saying where the error is. This is from the debugger.

#Q1: Can all of your teammates confidently predict the URL to use to load this page?
Prediction: http://localhost:5000/my_foist_template
Reality: Correct!

#Q2: What is the significance of each argument?
Prediction:
0th Argument: specifies file to use as template
1st Argument: replaces the foo kwarg with "fooooo"
2nd Argument: It loads coll as a vertical list of items, following the for loop kwarg in the body.
Reality:
0th: correct!
1st: correct! (we know because the title is the string, as is expected according to the html)
2nd: correct!
