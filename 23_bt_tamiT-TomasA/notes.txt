# QCC
 * Containers add margin to content to center it on the page.
 * Bootstrap seems to not have a lot of CSS on the nav, at least with color specification.
	 * Good for customizability, bad for quickly getting something that looks nice.
 * Container breakpoint is it follows margin rules IFF it meets the minimum size requirements. Like Foundation cells.
 * Containers are the Bootstrap equivalent of Foundation's grid-x.
	 * cols are their cell equivalent. 12 1-width cols fit into a horizontal space. Size specifications just like cells.
	 * Rows specify which row the cols are on. Foundation does this automagically. Bootstrap does not.
