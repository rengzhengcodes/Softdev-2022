HTML:
* <form action="/auth">
	* when form is submitted it invokes the /auth route

Python:
* @app.route("/", methods = ["GET", "POST"])
	* on by default
	* "GET" means ability to access the function
	* "POST" means ability to respond as the function
* app
	* prints the server stats
* request
	* thing telling the server "hey, do this for me"
	*  request.args
		* the arguments of the request as a dictionary. Usually are form responses
	* request.headers
		* A request's shipping label/letter header. A request is basically a big box of mail, the header is the thing the post service uses to deliver the mail and identify the sender.
