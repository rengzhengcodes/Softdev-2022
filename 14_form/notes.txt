#K14 -- Flask Day 04 (probably) Forms!
#2021-10-14

The website will store a cache of relevant information - this will impact whether having Flask methods such as 'GET' or 'POST' will cause a website malfunction because said information may already be stored for convencience. Thus, make sure to clear you cache to determine the impact that those functions have.

Software development seems to use a lot of mail metaphors (i.e. 'GET' and 'POST').

HTML:
* <form action="/auth">
	* when form is submitted it invokes the /auth route

Python:
* @app.route("/", methods = ["GET", "POST"])
	* on by default
	* "GET" means ability to access the function
	* "POST" means ability to respond as the function
* app
	* prints the server stats
* request
	* thing telling the server "hey, do this for me"
	*  request.args
		* the arguments of the request as a dictionary. Usually are form responses
	* request.headers
		* A request's shipping label/letter header. A request is basically a big box of mail, the header is the thing the post service uses to deliver the mail and identify the sender.
