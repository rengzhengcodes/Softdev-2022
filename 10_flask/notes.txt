Notes:

V0:

Same file as from yesterday. See notes from 09_flask-v0/bigbrain.txt

V1:

@app.route("/")
 - seems to tell the code that when a user accesses the website's root (website.com/, it runs the function)
 - Printouts seem the same despite removal of print(__name__) for all tested methods. EDIT: It's false we just didn't see it.

V2:

- difference was the print statements of print(__name__) and a print statement saying that we're about to print that was added.
- when the root page was accessed, the console printed 
"
about to print __name__...
__main__
