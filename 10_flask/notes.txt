Notes:

V0:

Same file as from yesterday. See notes from 09_flask-v0/bigbrain.txt

V1:

@app.route("/")
 - seems to tell the code that when a user accesses the website's root (website.com/, it runs the function) EDIT: Confirmed
 - Printouts seem the same despite removal of print(__name__) for all tested methods. EDIT: It's false we just didn't see it.

V2:

- difference was the print statements of print(__name__) and a print statement saying that we're about to print that was added. EDIT: printed the messages in terminal
	- when the root page was accessed, the console printed 
	"
	about to print __name__...
	__main__
	127.0.0.1 - - [04/Oct/2021 08:20:19] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
	"

V3:

 - app.debug = True means we turned on website debug mode. EDIT: it said it did, but what did it do?
	 - Starting printout changed to:
	 " * Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
	  * Environment: production
	    WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
	    Use a production WSGI server instead.
	  * Debug mode: on
	  * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
	  * Restarting with stat
	  * Debugger is active!
	  * Debugger PIN: 125-144-047
	 "
	  
 - Besides that nothing changed. We do not know where to enter the debugger PIN. EDIT: further versions showed no new knowledge.
	 - Console did not work. EDIT: nothing we found in browser dev tools did either
 - Runs the server when you import it from another file
 
V4:

 - Nothing has changed output-wise from V3.
 - For V4 it now seems that it only runs app if the python file is the main one called. EDIT: true
 - Debugger stuff still not figured out. EDIT: currently still true
 - It runs nothing if you just import the file from another file. Edit: true
