#K06 -- Reading from a CSV
#2021-09-28

# Findings
#1 Knowing a library well and its functionality is better with documentation
## than stabbing blindly in the dark.
#2 Doing frequent run checks is good so that you make sure that you aren't
## working with code that you will have to scrap later because it just doesn't
## work.
#3 Commit frequently in case you need to go back.

## CSV Specific Findings:
#1 The CSV dictreader likes to read it in with the first row as a header for
## the columns of every subsequent node. Very annoying if you don't want that.
#2 Basically an excel spreadsheet with each "cell" being which newline its
## on and how many commas in it is.

# Testing
#1 Testing is very important to verify code integrity. While it might work
## nominally on the surface, there may be hidden, unconsidered complications.
#2 You can import a *.py file in the same directory with a simple import
## statement. This imports both the functions and any defined variables.
#4 All the code in a *.py file (except if it is inside of a function
## declaration is run at the time the file is imported.
##1 Function declarations are also run, but the contents the function is
### wrapping do not.
##2 Basically like the exec() command.
